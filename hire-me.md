I started to learn programming when I was 16 and by that time I didn't know that this hobby would become my life. As most developers, my youth was most about playing video games and doing websites for fun. After high school, I started Computer Science and got a job as a trainee. I was loving what I was doing and then I started to work in a full-time job. I finished my graduation in 2015 and started to work as a freelance software engineer.

As a developer, my main goal is to build products that meet people needs. While doing that, I always try to code in a clean way, with automated tests to help me doing refactoring and watching my code to be easy to understand by other developers.
